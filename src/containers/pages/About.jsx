                        I hate cleaning, so those dirty dishes and I aren’t very good friends. I’d much rather make the food than clean up after it, anyone want to trade =)? Maybe someday, just someday, I will be organized and punctual. For now we’ll say I’m scaterized (opposite of organized) and functional :).

                        I’ve never really cared for novels but I’ve always loved cookbooks and food magazines. They have pictures, novels don’t. I love art and traveling.

                        My goal in life is to be a great mother and wife and to inspire those I love to follow their dreams. I’m a Mormon and I’m so grateful to be (you can learn more about my faith at Mormon.org, or you can email me with questions).

                        My goal here is to publish recipes that you, your family and your friends will not only love but will want to make time and time again. I hope to inspire you as a home cook and boost your confidence in the kitchen. Life is meant to be enjoyed and doesn’t good food just make it more enjoyable? Please follow along and lets create something delicious!
